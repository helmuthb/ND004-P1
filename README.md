# Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree - P1: Movie Trailer Website

This is the project 1 implementation for the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree, implementing a simple movie trailer website.

## Prerequisites

To use this program one has to have Python installed. For Mac OSX and Linux this is probably already available.
For Windows it is recommended to use the latest Python 2 version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

## Class design

The class `Movie` contains the following data items:
 - `title` - the title of the movie
 - `story_line` - a short description of the movie's story
 - `poster_image_url` - URL to a poster image
 - `trailer_youtube_url` - URL to the trailer for the movie on youtube
 - `actors` - array of actors
 - `release_date` - year or exact release date of the movie

The class' constructor (or more exactly initializer function) __init__ copies the arguments into these fields.

## Running the application

To run the application execute the python file `entertainment_center.py` in the folder.
